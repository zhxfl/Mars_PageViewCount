Page View Count (PVC): A log entry is a 3-ary tuple <U RL,
IP , Cookie>, where U RL is the URL of the accessed page; IP
is the IP of the host accessing the page; Cookie is the cookie infor-
mation generated when the page is accessed. This application has
two executions of MapReduce. The first one removes the duplicate
entries in the web logs. The second one counts the number of page
views for each page. In the first MapReduce, each Map takes the
pair of a log entry as the key and the size of the entry as value. The
sort is to eliminate the redundancy in the web log. Specifically,
if more than one log entries have the same information, we keep
only one of them. The first MapReduce outputs the result pair of
the log entry as key and the size of the line as value. It requires
both sort and the reduce stage. The second MapReduce processes
the key/value pairs generated from the first MapReduce. The Map
outputs the URL as the key and the IP as the value. In the second
MapReduce, sort is required and no reduce stage is required.
